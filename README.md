# Arduino_SMS_Link_With_Mesh
Based on the Woo sketch "SMS__Response" using adafruit libraries modified by Woo. Need to take care Original Adafruit libraries don't interfere, working on Arduino IDE but not yet in platformio  
***************************************************  
Aim, modify this code to relay messages from "Client trap" to a smartphone and commands from phone to "client trap"  intermediate aim, save Arduino IDE version to Gtihub till working on Platformio
